# Project_Euler: Minimal Network Problem
Java Code for solving Minimal Network Problem

Problem Statement : Find the maximum saving which can be acheived in a given graph by cutting out the edges provided the graph remains connected.

 A spanning tree is defined as: Given an undirected and connected graph $G=(V,E)$, a spanning tree of the graph G is a tree that spans G (that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph of G (every edge in the tree belongs to G). 
 A minimum spanning tree has the smallest cost(sum of weights) among the set of spanning trees.
 
 

 Kruskal's Algorithm is implemented to find the minimum spanning tree.
